Hi, I'm **tonyvr!**

My GitHub handle is vruumllc, because VRUUM LLC is the entity I created for consulting.

**'VRUUM'** is that loud sucking sound heard when my hobbies encounter my bank account.

My latest obsession is with the [Picocomputer 6502](https://picocomputer.github.io/), otherwise known as the RP6502.

Here's the [RP6502 Portable](https://github.com/orgs/picocomputer/discussions/50) I designed. See other RP6502 projects below!
