Hi, I'm **tonyvr!**


-----------

My GitHub handle is vruumllc, because VRUUM LLC is the entity I created for consulting.

**'VRUUM'** is that loud sucking sound heard when my hobbies encounter my bank account.

My latest obsession is with the [Picocomputer 6502](https://picocomputer.github.io/), otherwise known as the RP6502.

The 'RP6502 Portable' I designed is shown at left. See my other RP6502 projects below!
